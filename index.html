    I am currently working for Amazon Web Services as a Machine Learning Data Linguist. I am also a Collaborative Development Editor at <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em>. I received a PhD in English with a GR certificate in the Digital Humanities at Texas A&M University. My PhD dissertation focuses on computational approaches in the humanities with computer vision and natural language processing. I received a MA in English Literary Studies from the University of Exeter and a BA in English Literature (minor in Linguistics) from the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

    I first learned how to code when I was 8 years old, and practiced coding by making computer games similar to Galaga. I passed my first computer certification exam when I was 9 years old. I began to learn English and Japanese when I was 12 years old, and I passed the N3 JLPT(Japanese-Language Proficiency Test) when I was 16 years old. I was into computer software and hardware when I was young, and I started to be immersed in literature when I was in high school.

    During my PhD, I created the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/elibooklover/victorian400">Victorian400</a> dataset for colorizing black-and-white nineteenth-century illustrations using deep learning and the <a href="https://github.com/elibooklover/VictorianLit">VictorianLit</a> dataset for machine learning-based sentiment analysis of Victorian literary texts. My articles <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000612/000612.html">"Sentiment Analysis: Limits and Progress of the Syuzhet Package and Its Lexicons"</a> and <a href="https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/ijhac.2021.0269">"Victorian400: Colorizing Victorian Illustrations"</a> were published by <i>Digital Humanities Quarterly</i> in June 2022 and <i>International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing</i> (<i>IJHAC</i>) in October 2021, respectively. My book chapter “Challenges of Collaboration: Pursing Computational Research in a Humanities Graduate Program” will be included in a series for <i>Debates in the Digital Humanities</i>.

    I taught a workshop "Deep Learning for Humanists" at DHSI2022. During my PhD, I taught the digital humanities and literature at Texas A&M University in College Station. In the spring of 2021, I taught ENGL 304: Topics in Digital Research at Texas A&M University and created <a href="https://elibooklover.github.io/ENGL304-Spring2021/">a course website</a> and <a href="https://elibooklover.github.io/Tutorials/">online course tutorial</a> for ENGL 304. I have taught ENGL 203 (Writing about Literature), ENGL 210 (Technical Business Writing), and ENGL 104 (Composition & Rhetoric) at Texas A&M University.

    I also have other publications, including an academic article, and have participated in digital projects for three years, during which I helped to publish the history of British Kings and Queens and an online literary encyclopedia: <a href="https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=3326637&cid=56790&categoryId=58124">Queen Victoria in NAVER History Encyclopedia</a> (NAVER is Korea’s most popular search engine, which also developed the LINE app). I have also worked on commercial mobile apps. Namely, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gindosolution.gindoapp.ktownrewards">K-Town Rewards in DC</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gindosolution.gindoapp.vinnys">Vinny’s 17</a> on the App Store and Google Play, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tulango.student">Tulango</a> on Google Play.
