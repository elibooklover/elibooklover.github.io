    I am a Digital Humanist, Data Scientist, and Victorianist. I am currently a PhD candidate in English at Texas A&M University. I received a MA in English Literary Studies from the University of Exeter and a BA in English Literature (minor in Linguistics) from the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

    I first learned how to code when I was 8 years old, and practiced coding by making computer games similar to Galaga. I passed my first computer certification exam when I was 9 years old. I began to learn English and Japanese when I was 12 years old, and I passed the N3 JLPT(Japanese-Language Proficiency Test) when I was 16 years old. I was into computer software and hardware when I was young, and I started to be immersed in literature when I was in high school.

    Although I was disciplined in the humanities at universities, I was also trained at IT companies by co-workers who worked for Samsung, LG, or HP. I deal with computer programming/markup languages and frameworks such as R, Swift, Python, SAS, JSON, HTML, CSS, TEI/XML, Jekyll, WordPress, Django, PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow. I am interested in working in interdisciplinary studies by combining literature and computer/data science.

    I presented my work on sentiment analysis packages at ACH 2019 in Pittsburgh during July, 2019. I presented my paper, “Digital Analysis of Dickensian Characters and the Language of Emotion,” at the 2018 Dickens Society Symposium in Tübingen, Germany, during the summer of 2018. I also attended the Digital Humanities Summer Institute at the University of Victoria in the summer of 2018 with funding from both CoDHR and the Department of English at Texas A&M University. In the Spring of 2021, I am teaching <a href="https://elibooklover.github.io/ENGL304-Spring2021/">ENGL 304: Topics in Digital Research</a> at Texas A&M University.

    I am currently working on my PhD dissertation “Computational Approaches in the Humanities from Sentiment Analysis to Machine Learning Colorization.” I am the creator of the <a href="https://github.com/elibooklover/Victorian400">Victorian400</a> dataset for colorizing black-and-white nineteenth-century illustrations using deep learning and the <a href="https://github.com/elibooklover/VictorianLit">VictorianLit</a> dataset for machine learning-based sentiment analysis of Victorian literary texts.

    I also have some publications, including an academic article, and have participated in digital projects for three years, during which I helped to publish the history of British Kings and Queens and an online literary encyclopedia: <a href="https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=3326637&cid=56790&categoryId=58124">Queen Victoria in NAVER History Encyclopedia</a> (NAVER is Korea’s most popular search engine, which also developed the LINE app). I have also worked on commercial mobile apps. Namely, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gindosolution.gindoapp.ktownrewards">K-Town Rewards in DC</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gindosolution.gindoapp.vinnys">Vinny’s 17</a> on the App Store and Google Play, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tulango.student">Tulango</a> on Google Play.
