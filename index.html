    I am a Digital Humanist, Data Scientist, and Victorianist. I am currently a PhD candidate (ABD) in English at Texas A&M University. I received a MA in English Literary Studies from the University of Exeter and a BA in English Literature (minor in Linguistics) from the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

    I first learned how to code when I was 8 years old, and practiced coding by making computer games similar to Galaga. I passed my first computer certification exam when I was 9 years old. I began to learn English and Japanese when I was 12 years old, and I passed the N3 JLPT(Japanese-Language Proficiency Test) when I was 16 years old. I was into computer software and hardware when I was young, and I started to be immersed in literature when I was in high school.

    Although I was disciplined in the humanities at universities, I was also trained at IT companies by co-workers who worked for Samsung, LG, or HP. I deal with computer programming/markup languages and frameworks such as Python, R, SAS, Swift, HTML, CSS, TEI/XML, Jekyll, WordPress, Django, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. I am interested in working in interdisciplinary studies by combining literature and computer/data science.

    I am currently working on my PhD dissertation “Computational Approaches in the Humanities from Text Mining to Deep Learning Colorization.” I am the creator of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/elibooklover/victorian400">Victorian400</a> dataset for colorizing black-and-white nineteenth-century illustrations using deep learning and the <a href="https://github.com/elibooklover/VictorianLit">VictorianLit</a> dataset for machine learning-based sentiment analysis of Victorian literary texts. My article “Victorian400: Colorizing Victorian Illustrations” will be published in <i>International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing</i> (<i>IJHAC</i>) in October, 2021. My book chapter “Challenges of Collaboration: Pursing Computational Research in a Humanities Graduate Program” will be included in a series for <i>Debates in the Digital Humanities</i>.

    I am going to present two works at the ACH2021 conference in the summer of 2021: “Challenges and Considerations of Computational Literary Analysis in Different Languages” and “The Automatic Generation of Grammar Questions and Answers for English Learners.” In addition, I am planning to present “Dickensian Sentiment and Sentiment Analysis of Victorian Novels” at the Dickens Society Symposium in the summer of 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have participated in various conferences in the digital humanities and the humanities. I presented “Pursuing Computational Humanities Research as a Graduate Student in the Humanities” at the Engaging Open Social Scholarship (EOSS) conference in December 2020. I also presented my work on sentiment analysis packages at ACH 2019 in Pittsburgh during July, 2019 and my paper, “Digital Analysis of Dickensian Characters and the Language of Emotion,” at the 2018 Dickens Society Symposium in Tübingen, Germany, during the summer of 2018.

    <p>
    I have taught the digital humanities and literature at Texas A&M University in College Station. In the spring of 2021, I taught ENGL 304: Topics in Digital Research at Texas A&M University and created <a href="https://elibooklover.github.io/ENGL304-Spring2021/">a course website</a> and <a href="https://elibooklover.github.io/Tutorials/">online course tutorial</a> for ENGL 304. I have taught ENGL 203 (Writing about Literature), ENGL 210 (Technical Business Writing), and ENGL 104 (Composition & Rhetoric) at Texas A&M University.
    </p>

    <p>
    I also have other publications, including an academic article, and have participated in digital projects for three years, during which I helped to publish the history of British Kings and Queens and an online literary encyclopedia: <a href="https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=3326637&cid=56790&categoryId=58124">Queen Victoria in NAVER History Encyclopedia</a> (NAVER is Korea’s most popular search engine, which also developed the LINE app). I have also worked on commercial mobile apps. Namely, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gindosolution.gindoapp.ktownrewards">K-Town Rewards in DC</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gindosolution.gindoapp.vinnys">Vinny’s 17</a> on the App Store and Google Play, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tulango.student">Tulango</a> on Google Play.
